# Module 01 Challenge

## Description

This challenge deals with refactoring existing code for a web application. The main goal while refactoring the code was to help the overall accessibility of the site. 
Accessibility is an important aspect for applications and sites on the web; it's crucial to ensure people with disabilities can properly access the site while using various assistive technologies (screen readers, video captions, etc.). Another benefit of having a properly accessible website is better placement and optimization in search engines. 
Refactoring the pre-existing code consisted of re-structuring and replacing vague HTML elements with semantic ones, adding alt descriptions to images, giving the webpage a descriptive title, adding keyword metadata, consolidating CSS properties, and adding helpful comments in the code. 
While completing this challenge, I learned new semantic HTML elements and found creative ways to consolidate CSS properties. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To view the published webpage, go to ajprobel@github.io/module-01-challenge

To view the newly-improved HTML code, open up the "index.html" file within the "Develop" folder. Note the structure of the code, the semantic HTML elements, the organization of the head, and various comments throughout.

To view the newly-improved CSS code, open up the "style.css" file within "Develop > assets > css". The previous CSS code had a length of 201 lines. Minus comments, the new CSS code has been consolidated to 137 lines.
